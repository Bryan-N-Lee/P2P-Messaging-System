P2P-Messaging-System (C++)
==========================

P2P Messaging System is a more stable version of the Secure P2P Messaging Client application, but without the encryption of packets.

Description: 
A peer-to-peer instant messaging client that is capable of sending and receiving messages. It currently uses local network broadcasts to discover other users on the same network. Future development will include communication between users who are not on the same network through the use of a server to help users find targeted users.
